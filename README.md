# Replication Project
This project is a replication of Figures 1 and 2 from Cruces et al.'s (2023) ["Dishonesty and Public Employment" paper in AEA: Insights](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20220550).

The data and STATA code are made publicly available by the authors through [openICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/185801/version/V1/view). 

## Premise 
Using data of Argentine men born between 1958 and 1962, Cruces et al. propose a causal relationship between dishonesty measured through
failure rate a of a medical exam determining military conscription, and future public employment. Ordinary least squares and 2-stage least-squares regression analysis, with distance to a randomized cutoff as an instrumental variable, are used to estimate this relationship[^1]. 

Figure 1 demonstrates the relationship between the instrument and the explanatory variable, and figure 2 demonstrates the relationship between the instrument and the dependent variable (reduced-form regression).
